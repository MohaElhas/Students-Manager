Welcome.





This software is written in C++.





The purpose of this software is to manage a school at a very simple level. You will understand why. The software is divided into three departments and each department has its own rights toward some software elements, mainly students, courses and notes. A student can register himself or see his notes. A teacher can search a student or add notes to a student. An administrator can basically do everything, but not really. He can search a student, create one (register one), display a student's notes, create a course, display all the notes of a course or all the notes of a particular student, which is executed by creating a text file, writing in it and displaying it. He can also display all the students and all the courses.





That's it.





Have fun using it!!!
